# MarchMadness2024
 March Madness generator for 2024 bracket. This one pulls from the hidden ESPN API and computes (albeit a random algorithm) the winner. One main goal of this is no matter how many times you run it will always produce the the same result. I don't want to be second guessing how many times I should run the program. This solves that issue and produces the same result every single time as long as the data provided in the same.
